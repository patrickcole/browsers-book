### Raw Unorganized Notes and Thoughts ###

* First browser that was easy to use for everyone.
* Helped introduce the Internet to the public.
* Broke the mold for how to make a free, upgradable web browser for people to use and understand. (NOTE: The point I'm trying to make is the software was free and Netscape developers were constantly trying to make it better.)
* November 24, 1998 - AOL acquires Netscape Communications.

* Netscape provided JavaScript and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (qz.com)
* Open-sourced code which led to Mozilla.
* July 2003, AOL helps create Mozilla Foundation, which would lead to Firefox.
